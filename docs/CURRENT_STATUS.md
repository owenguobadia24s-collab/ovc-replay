# Current status

Snapshot date: 26 July 2026.

## Integrated baseline

The reset and OPT-A v2 build line through selector activation are merged into `main`:

- R0 reset: `a9902c97e21131b1882b4c11ca3a2a79273e7c77`
- OPT-A WP1-WP6 and A2-G0 through A2-G5: complete
- A2-G5 selector activation: `fb5b2fea2200b05a050aa1f8af51121a1883a4a5`

Historical `OPT-A.GBPUSD.2026H1.v1` remains `SUPERSEDED_UNPUBLISHED`, unavailable and prohibited as a selector, parent or rollback target.

## Active OPT-A v2 role set

| Role | Release | Authority | Selector | Consumption |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discovery | `OPT-A.GBPUSD.DISCOVERY.2021_2023.v2` | `ACTIVE_DISCOVERY` | `ACTIVE` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| Development | `OPT-A.GBPUSD.DEVELOPMENT.2024.v2` | `ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT` | `ACTIVE` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| Validation | `OPT-A.GBPUSD.VALIDATION.2025.v2` | `ACTIVE_VALIDATION` | `ACTIVE` | `LOCKED_UNCONSUMED` |

The **21,410** quarantined derived-bucket records remain bound to `RETAIN_TRACE_AND_EXCLUDE_FROM_ACCEPTED_OBSERVATIONS` and cannot become downstream parents.

## OPT-B.C1 v2 WP1

WP1 result: `PASS — CLEAN C1 BOUNDARY APPROVED`.

The repository now freezes:

- C1 as an explicit atomic, stateless fact layer;
- the active OPT-A v2 selector set as the only admissible upstream market authority;
- 15M and 2H_A_L BID/ASK as the initial canonical C1 candidate scope;
- H1 derived/native clocks as controls only;
- a strict dependency allowlist and denylist;
- dedicated C1 namespaces and identities;
- an explicit deferred-capability register.

WP2 contract, formula-registry, schema and null-policy work is authorised. No C1 market replay, release, publication or selector activation is authorised.

## Active authority matrix

| Boundary | State | Selector |
|---|---|---|
| Evidence store | `ACTIVE_INFRASTRUCTURE / REMOTE_VERIFIED` | Not applicable |
| OPT-A v1 | `SUPERSEDED_UNPUBLISHED / MISSING` | `NONE` |
| OPT-A v2 role set | `A2_G5_PASS / ACTIVE` | `ACTIVE` |
| OPT-B.C1 v2 | `WP1_BOUNDARY_PASS / WP2_DESIGN_AUTHORISED` | `NONE` |
| OPT-B.C2 v2 | `DESIGN_AND_FIXTURES_ONLY` | `NONE` |
| C2E / C2.5 / C3 | `DEFERRED` | `NONE` |
| OPT-C / OPT-D | `HISTORICAL_QUARANTINED` | `NONE` |

Validation remains `LOCKED_UNCONSUMED`. C1 cannot read C2/C/D, future paths, outcomes, semantic labels, story records, probability, exposure or execution objects.

## Next boundary

`OPT-B.C1 v2 WP2 — contract, formula registry and schemas`
