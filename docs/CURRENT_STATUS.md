# Current status

Snapshot date: 26 July 2026.

## Integrated baseline

The reset and OPT-A v2 build line through selector activation are merged into `main`:

- R0 reset: `a9902c97e21131b1882b4c11ca3a2a79273e7c77`
- OPT-A WP1-WP6 and A2-G0 through A2-G5: complete
- A2-G5 selector activation: `fb5b2fea2200b05a050aa1f8af51121a1883a4a5`
- OPT-B.C1 v2 WP1 boundary: `3940f64a635f547a6bef6045bd3a8a27e386dcdd`
- OPT-B.C1 v2 WP2 design freeze: `fefac25f19a836898c3a22228036cd66617dca07`

Historical `OPT-A.GBPUSD.2026H1.v1` remains `SUPERSEDED_UNPUBLISHED`, unavailable and prohibited as a selector, parent or rollback target.

## Active OPT-A v2 role set

| Role | Release | Authority | Selector | Consumption |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discovery | `OPT-A.GBPUSD.DISCOVERY.2021_2023.v2` | `ACTIVE_DISCOVERY` | `ACTIVE` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| Development | `OPT-A.GBPUSD.DEVELOPMENT.2024.v2` | `ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT` | `ACTIVE` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| Validation | `OPT-A.GBPUSD.VALIDATION.2025.v2` | `ACTIVE_VALIDATION` | `ACTIVE` | `LOCKED_UNCONSUMED` |

The **21,410** quarantined derived-bucket records remain bound to `RETAIN_TRACE_AND_EXCLUDE_FROM_ACCEPTED_OBSERVATIONS` and cannot become downstream parents.

## OPT-B.C1 v2 WP3

WP3 result: `PASS — REFERENCE ENGINE AND FIXTURE TRUST`.

The repository now contains:

- strict typed adaptation of approved OPT-A-v2-shaped source bars;
- exact Decimal implementation of `C1.FORMULAS.v0.1`;
- explicit zero-range and non-computable outputs;
- one-step contiguous-prior-close resolution with no gap search;
- deterministic `c1:<sha256>` identity independent of path, runtime and machine;
- canonical UTF-8 JSON serialization;
- local validation of null/reason parity, clock, side and formula identity;
- tests covering deterministic rerun, geometry, zero range, gaps, side mismatch, H1 controls, legacy parent denial and Validation lock.

All WP3 computation remains synthetic/golden-fixture-only. No market payload was replayed and no release was created.

## Active authority matrix

| Boundary | State | Selector |
|---|---|---|
| Evidence store | `ACTIVE_INFRASTRUCTURE / REMOTE_VERIFIED` | Not applicable |
| OPT-A v1 | `SUPERSEDED_UNPUBLISHED / MISSING` | `NONE` |
| OPT-A v2 role set | `A2_G5_PASS / ACTIVE` | `ACTIVE` |
| OPT-B.C1 v2 | `WP3_REFERENCE_ENGINE_FIXTURE_TRUST_PASS` | `NONE` |
| OPT-B.C2 v2 | `DESIGN_AND_FIXTURES_ONLY` | `NONE` |
| C2E / C2.5 / C3 | `DEFERRED` | `NONE` |
| OPT-C / OPT-D | `HISTORICAL_QUARANTINED` | `NONE` |

Validation remains `LOCKED_UNCONSUMED`. C1 market replay, local release freeze, R2 publication, selector activation and C2 consumption remain denied.

## Next boundary

`C1-G0 — WP3 reference-engine review and WP4 replay-scope approval`
